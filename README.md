# Sensor Board Project

A collaborative hardware and software project to develop a sensor board for our product portfolio, aligned with OCR A Level Computer Science H446 Programming Project requirements.

## Project Team

- **Hardware Team**: Michael Hull, Ollie Hull
- **Software Team**: Alex Lennon (Lead), Anthony Lennon (Student)
- **Project Duration**: 2026 Academic Year

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a sensor board that can be integrated into our product portfolio. The project balances real-world engineering practices with educational objectives, ensuring Anthony gains practical experience in both software and hardware engineering while meeting OCR A Level assessment criteria.

## Quick Start

1. Review `docs/project_management/PROJECT_PLAN.md` for overall project structure
2. Review `docs/01_analysis/REQUIREMENTS.md` for detailed requirements
3. Check `docs/README.md` for documentation structure
4. See `docs/01_analysis/PROJECT_PROPOSAL_EXAMPLE.md` for project proposal
5. See `software/` for implementation code

## OCR Assessment Alignment

This project is structured to meet OCR A Level Computer Science H446 Component 03 requirements:

- **Analysis (10 marks)**: Problem definition, stakeholders, success criteria
- **Design (15 marks)**: System architecture, data structures, algorithms
- **Development & Testing (25 marks)**: Implementation and comprehensive testing
- **Evaluation & Documentation (20 marks)**: Assessment and documentation

Total: **70 marks**
