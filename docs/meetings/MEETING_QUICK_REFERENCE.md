# Meeting Quick Reference Card
**Project Kickoff - January 13, 2026**

## Critical Decisions Needed

### 1. Hardware Specifications
- [ ] **Sensors**: What sensors? (temperature, humidity, motion, etc.)
- [ ] **Interface**: I2C, SPI, UART, or USB?
- [ ] **Microcontroller**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or custom?
- [ ] **Timeline**: When will hardware be ready?

**OCR Link**: Analysis section requires hardware/software requirements

### 2. Software Scope
- [ ] **Core Features**: What must software do?
- [ ] **Architecture**: On-board or connected computer?
- [ ] **Data Storage**: Database, files, or both?
- [ ] **API/GUI**: What interface for users?

**OCR Link**: Analysis section - requirements specification

### 3. Anthony's Work
- [ ] **What will Anthony develop?** (sensor drivers, API, GUI, etc.)
- [ ] **Complexity level**: Appropriate for A Level?
- [ ] **Learning objectives**: What skills should he demonstrate?
- [ ] **Mentoring approach**: How will Alex support?

**OCR Link**: Development section - must demonstrate programming skills

### 4. Technology Stack
- [ ] **Language**: Python? (recommended for sensors)
- [ ] **IDE**: Which development environment?
- [ ] **Libraries**: What sensor/communication libraries?
- [ ] **Version Control**: Git (required for OCR evidence)

**OCR Link**: Must use high-level text-based language

### 5. Success Criteria (Must Be Measurable!)
- [ ] **Accuracy**: e.g., "Temperature ±0.5°C"
- [ ] **Performance**: e.g., "Response time <100ms"
- [ ] **Quality**: e.g., "Test coverage >80%"
- [ ] **Educational**: e.g., "Achieve X marks in OCR assessment"

**OCR Link**: Analysis section - measurable success criteria required

### 6. Timeline
- [ ] **OCR Deadline**: When is submission?
- [ ] **Hardware Delivery**: When available for software development?
- [ ] **Phase Dates**: Analysis (W1-2), Design (W3-4), Dev (W5-10), Eval (W13-14)

**OCR Link**: See PROJECT_PLAN.md for 14-week timeline

### 7. Research Plan
- [ ] **5+ Similar Solutions**: Which to research? (Arduino, RPi, commercial)
- [ ] **Stakeholder Meetings**: When? (Hardware team, end users)
- [ ] **Research Timeline**: When complete?

**OCR Link**: Analysis section - research 5+ similar solutions required
