## Next Steps After Kickoff

1. **Week 1**: Complete analysis phase
2. **Week 2**: Finalize requirements, begin design
3. **Week 3-4**: Complete design phase
4. **Week 5+**: Begin development

## Questions to Answer

- What sensors will the board support?
- What is the primary use case?
- What communication interface?
- What programming language for software?
- What is the target platform?
- What are the performance requirements?
- What is the budget/timeline?
- How will we test the system?
- How will we document the project?
