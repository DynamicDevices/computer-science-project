## OCR Assessment Alignment

The project is structured to meet all OCR requirements:

| Section | Marks | Location | Status |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| Analysis | 10 | `docs/01_analysis/` | Templates ready |
| Design | 15 | `docs/02_design/` | Templates ready |
| Development & Testing | 25 | `docs/03_development/` | Templates ready |
| Evaluation | 20 | `docs/04_evaluation/` | Templates ready |
| **Total** | **70** | | |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Kickoff)
1. ✅ Review PROJECT_PLAN.md
2. ✅ Review docs/01_analysis/REQUIREMENTS.md template
3. ⬜ Obtain OCR specification document
4. ⬜ Place OCR document in `resources/` folder
5. ⬜ Review KICKOFF_CHECKLIST.md
6. ⬜ Schedule kickoff meeting

### Kickoff Meeting
1. Review project goals and structure
2. Define sensor board specifications (hardware team)
3. Define software requirements
4. Select technology stack
5. Agree on timeline and milestones
6. Complete docs/01_analysis/REQUIREMENTS.md

### Week 1-2: Analysis Phase
1. Complete problem statement
2. Finalize stakeholder analysis
3. Define success criteria
4. Complete requirements document
5. Begin analysis documentation

### Week 3-4: Design Phase
1. Design system architecture
2. Define data structures
3. Specify algorithms
4. Create design diagrams
5. Complete design documentation

### Week 5-12: Development Phase
1. Set up development environment
2. Implement core functionality
3. Write tests
4. Iterate and refine
5. Document progress

### Week 13-14: Evaluation Phase
1. Evaluate against success criteria
2. Analyze performance
3. Document limitations
4. Propose improvements
5. Complete reflection
6. Finalize documentation

## Key Documents

- **PROJECT_PLAN.md**: Overall project structure, timeline, OCR alignment
- **docs/01_analysis/REQUIREMENTS.md**: Detailed requirements (to be completed)
- **STUDENT_GUIDE.md**: Guide for Anthony to get started
- **KICKOFF_CHECKLIST.md**: Checklist for project kickoff meeting
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for team contributions

## Team Roles

- **Hardware**: Michael & Ollie Hull - Sensor board design
- **Software Lead**: Alex Lennon - Software architecture and mentoring
- **Student**: Anthony Lennon - Learning and contributing to software

## Success Factors

1. ✅ Clear project structure aligned with OCR requirements
2. ✅ Templates for all documentation sections
3. ✅ Learning-focused approach for Anthony
4. ✅ Real-world business value
5. ⬜ Team alignment (kickoff meeting needed)
6. ⬜ Requirements finalized
7. ⬜ Technology stack selected

## Questions to Answer

Before starting development, the team needs to decide:

1. **Hardware**: What sensors? What interface? What form factor?
2. **Software**: What programming language? What architecture?
3. **Integration**: How will hardware and software communicate?
4. **Timeline**: Are the 14 weeks realistic? Any adjustments needed?
5. **Scope**: What's the minimum viable product?

## Getting Help

- Review the documentation in each folder
- Check STUDENT_GUIDE.md for Anthony
- Use KICKOFF_CHECKLIST.md for the kickoff meeting
- Follow CONTRIBUTING.md for development workflow

## Status

**Current Status**: Project structure created, ready for kickoff meeting

**Next Milestone**: Kickoff meeting and requirements finalization
